# Malware-Analysis-Low-Level-Code
The purpose of this program is to find a hidden password within the super star trek game. Once found
verify the password in order to ensure it is correct and then figure out a way to bypass the password check altogether.
I accomplished this by using Ghidra in order to find the password and edit the program's binaries in order to bypass the password 
I used a NOP sled by modifying the computer's instructions to just bypass it altogether as demonstrated in my writeup.

## Delivarables
1. Your modified, runnable (in working order) `sst` binary which will include:
   - Your name along with mine in the hacking credits
   - The Enterprise's destruct password *altered in the binary* to bypass the verification.
2. A screenshot of your terminal running the game, with your hacking credit name showing.
3. A write up with the following info:
    - The offsets of the locations changed
    - Which value each offset now contains
    - The original password that was set
    - How you bypassed the password
    - Your experiences with the project
    - Anything else you want to tell me
