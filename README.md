# Malware-Analysis-Low-Level-Code
1. **Don't apply any patches or third-party code to your binary file** other than the code *you* change. A simple run of a `diff` program will easily tell me which pieces have been changed and which haven't.
2. **Do your own work**. Cheating and plagiarism are at all time highs in our department and we are being extra watchful right now.
3. **Come to me if you need help**. Really. I'm surprised people don't do this *more*. There are some things that I won't be able tell you about, but quite a bit that I can.
4. **Have fun with this assignment**. It's *supposed* to be fun. Hard, yes. But the best puzzles are always the hardest ones ;-).

## Delivarables
1. Your modified, runnable (in working order) `sst` binary which will include:
   - Your name along with mine in the hacking credits
   - The Enterprise's destruct password *altered in the binary* to bypass the verification.
2. A screenshot of your terminal running the game, with your hacking credit name showing.
3. A write up with the following info:
    - The offsets of the locations changed
    - Which value each offset now contains
    - The original password that was set
    - How you bypassed the password
    - Your experiences with the project
    - Anything else you want to tell me
